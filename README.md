# Philosophers
I never thought philosophy would be so deadly - Learning Multi-threading in C

In this project I'll and learn pratice how multi-threading, mutexes, locks, and semaphores work by applying a well-known problem in OS development: [The dining Philhosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem). 

I'll also use this project to learn more about git if possible, so trying to use different branches for each feature, mearging the right way and keeping the code and the git history as clean as possible.
